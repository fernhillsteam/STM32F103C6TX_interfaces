/* p7_4.c: Use DAC to generate sawtooth waveform
 * The DAC is initialized with no buffer or trigger, so every 
 * write to the DAC data register will change the analog output.
 * The data is incremented in the loop and written to the DAC.
 * The output of DAC is on pin PA4.
 *
 * This program was tested with Keil uVision v5.24a with DFP v2.11.0.
