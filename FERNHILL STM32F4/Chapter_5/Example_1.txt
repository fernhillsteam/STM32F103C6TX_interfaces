/* p5_1.c Toggle Green LED (LD2) on STM32F446RE Nucleo64 using SysTick

 * This program configures SysTick to be a 24-bit free-running
 * down-counter. Bit 23 of SysTick current value is written to 
 * the LED (PA5) continuously.
 * SysTick is based on system clock running at 16 MHz. 
 * So bit 23 of SysTick current value toggles about 1 Hz
 * (16,000,000 Hz / 2^23 = 1.907 Hz).
 *
 * This program was tested with Keil uVision v5.24a with DFP v2.11.0
